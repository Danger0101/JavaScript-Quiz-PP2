# JavaScript-Quiz-PP2

JavaScript quiz made to showcase skills using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The purpose is to allow users to test their knowlesge of JavaScript. It uses 4 pages to accomplish the end goal of a functioning JavaScript quiz. With three seperate scripts. The main reason for this multy page set up rather then 1 page is cleaner code as it keeps scripts a bit cleaner and they only need to contain whats needed for each page. While a single page can be faster in some cases I feel this layout suited my intentions better. As the inital load of the page is faster then if everything was all jumbled together also means quiz resets each go around or if user refreshes the page. This site is intended to be used in a traditional desktop, laptop browser window, or a mobile device in portrait mode. Landscape is known to cause issues.
